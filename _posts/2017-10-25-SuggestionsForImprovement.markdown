Honestly, I really enjoyed reading through your job posting. It caused me to look up a bunch of things that I had never heard of, and it gave me a clear idea of the person you are looking for. I suppose the only suggestion I have is to perhaps include what the interviewing process looks like. Just because it seems sorta long and daunting. I'm not sure if a PT engineer at whatever company would have the time to sit for 4 different interviews. That's just my opinion, though.
