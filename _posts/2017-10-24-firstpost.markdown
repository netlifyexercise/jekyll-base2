**Favorite Things :-D**

- Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.

(Since I used to work as an editorial intern for a money-saving blog called The Penny Hoarder https://www.thepennyhoarder.com. Plus, I really enjoy writing!)

- Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model

(I'm pretty good at explaining things once I understand it well enough myself.)

- Respond to Netlify fans on Twitter

(I used to do this at The Penny Hoarder except instead of Twitter it was a FB group)

- Work with the development team to help design a new feature based on feedback from customers

- Dig through server logs to troubleshoot a customer's website behavior



**Least Favorite Things :-(**

- Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case

(I'm camera shy...that was part of the reason I left TPH. From time to time, I felt guilt-tripped into being in their photo shoots which was a big deal to me since they have about 7 million readers who could potentially see crappy pictures of me.)

- Deliver a talk to many people you don't know at a conference or meetup

(I'm working on my presentation skills. )

- Help manage communications during a service outage

(I used to intern at a power company in Detroit and whenever the power went out--which felt like every other week--I'd have to deal with angry customers)

- Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before

(I think over time I could get better at this but in the beginning I think I'd need a bit of help.)

- Manage a support team

(I feel awkward telling people what to do...)
