Hello so-and-so, I'm sorry to hear your site won't build. Let me try to help! First of all, are you using a verified email address? It might be useful to read through this documentation in case you aren't using a verified email: https://help.github.com/articles/verifying-your-email-address/

Is that not your problem? Perhaps, you are using unsupported plugins. Try to generate your site locally and then push your site's static files to your repository site.
