When I first started using Jekyll, I followed the documentation exactly to add new posts. But for some reason, this site (https://sentry-squirrel-30346.netlify.com/jekyll/update/2015/02/12/welcome-to-jekyll.html) said to use .ext as the file name extension. Well, this didn't work for me. So what I did was just use the same file extension as the "Welcome to Jekyll!" post which is .markdown.
