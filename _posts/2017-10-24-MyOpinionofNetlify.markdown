Well, in the beginning I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I tried a couple generators before I stuck with Jekyl. I liked Jekyl because it was the easiest one for me to post on (all I had to do was add a new file under /posts). Also, I wasn't sure how to deploy it from the command prompt so I just used the site to do it. This site, I mean: https://app.netlify.com/sites/sentry-squirrel-30346/deploys I thought for someone as newbish as myself that this was pretty easy to do. Your product seems fast and fairly easy to use.
